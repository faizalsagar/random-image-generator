# Random-image-generator
This is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Website that generates a random image and allows the user to switch between day mode and night mode.

The code has a container with an image element that generates a random image every time the page is loaded or when the user clicks the “Reload Image” button. The user can also reload the page by clicking the “Reload Page” button.

The code also includes a toggle switch that changes the background color to a dark mode when toggled on. The toggle switch changes its shape to a moon when in night mode and to a sun when in day mode.

At the bottom of the page, there is a footer section with the name of the author, a short description of the author’s profession, and links to the author’s social media profiles.

The HTML code is styled using CSS, and the JavaScript code handles the image generation, toggle switch functionality, and button animations.
